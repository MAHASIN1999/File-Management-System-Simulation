# File-Management-System-Simulation and performance analysis.
-Implemented and conducted performance analysis of various file structure simulations, including contiguous allocation, indexed allocation, linked allocation, and modified contiguous allocation. 
-The project aims to evaluate time complexity, internal fragmentation, and external fragmentation across different file structure strategies. The simulation provides insights into the efficiency and trade-offs of each approach without directly impacting a real file management system architecture
