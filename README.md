# File-Management-System-Simulation
implemented and compared performance of different file structure simulations such as contiguous allocation, indexed allocation, linked allocation

This program was made as a part of Assignement for the course CS588:Computer Systems Lab by Prof. Moumita Patra, IITG, CSE for semester Jan-May 2023 . Detailed Problem Statement can be found in Assignment6.pdf Question 2.

THis program is meant to compare the performance of different file structures in terms of time complexity and internal and external fragmentations.
